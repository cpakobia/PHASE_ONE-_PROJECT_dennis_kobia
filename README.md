# Phase 1 Project 

## Project Overview

In this project I haved used exploratory data analysis to generate insights for Microsoft Company,from information provided in these 3 files:imdb.title.basics, imdb.title.ratings,bom.movie_gross. From the results of my analysis I have made recommendations on the types of films that Microsoft needs to invest in.I have compared the total returns of film based on the genre of the film and the rating of the film. From the findings I adise the head oft Microsoft to focus on action,Sci-Fi, adventure, animation and thriller genres due to the high returns generated by these genres.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

#### The Data
I have used the data in the files

* imdb.title.basics
* imdb.title.ratings
* bom.movie_gross

##### Data cleaning
I perfomed data cleanig process on the 3 files provided. I dealt with the missing values and the duplicates. I also dropped the irrelevant columns. After the data was clean to my satsfaction I went on to analyse it.

###### Exploratory Data Analysis / Data Visualization
I Used the Combined gross to find the most profitable genres, which turned out to be:Action-Sci-Fi, Adventure-Comedy , Action-Comedy ,Action-Animation, Action-Thriller  and Action-Fantasy.
I then plotted this using a bar graph.

#MOST PROFITABLE GENRE

#RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENRE AND RATING

From this Bar Graph we can see DramaWestern has the highest rating, ActionThriller is second in rating, while AdventureDramaSci-Fi is the 3rd most rated tying with Documentary and ActionDrama genres


#Scatter plot to show relationship between Combined_gross_income and Average rating

From the above Scatter plot there is no clear relationship between the Combined_gross_income and the average rating. This shows the rating of a Film doesnt necessarily affect the revevue of the film


#Lineplot showing the Relationship between the domestic gross and foreign gross income from the Year of release

![Domestic gross and Foreign gross](https://github.com/cpakobia/PHASE_ONE-_PROJECT_dennis_kobia/assets/134348870/e8bf7b2a-6aee-4d7c-b341-152206d323d4)
Over the years, it can be observed that the foreign gross income of movies often surpasses their domestic gross income upon release. In 2018, movies achieved their highest earnings in both foreign and domestic markets. However, there was a significant drop in gross incomes for films released in 2019, which can be attributed to the growing preference of many individuals to utilize streaming services instead of visiting theaters.


#######Conclusions and Recommendations.

#CONCLUSION:

The genres of most of the Films that have been produced are drama,romance, comedy,sci -fi and action.The least released are sport documentary,comedy documentary and history films. Based on our analysis above the success of a film is determined mostly by the genre.The most profitable films are action adventure,action sci-fi, action comedy and action thriller.The average rating does not affect the sales of a film.From the above analysis we see documentary having a high average rating but it is has a low total gross income. Hence we ascertain that their is no clear relationship between the total gross income and the average rating.It is of importance to note that the foreign market has returned a high gross from the year of release compared to the domestic market.

#RECOMMENDATIONS:

Microsoft should consider venturing on action adventure,action sci-fi, action comedy and action thriller films. Microsoft should focus on exploring more the international markets which have had a higher gross over the years when compared to the domestic markets.
